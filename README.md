# 📋 Task Management Console App (JSL03)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple yet structured **task management system** built using vanilla JavaScript. The application allows users to **add new tasks, manage status**, and **filter completed tasks** — all through the browser console using interactive prompts.

The project is designed to help users organize their tasks effectively while learning about **array manipulation**, **object-oriented thinking**, and **user interaction** in JavaScript.
